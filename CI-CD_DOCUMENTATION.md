# !_PROJECT_NAME_! CI/CD documentation

* after merging the PR, the first run of the main workflow will not complete successfully, because it requires specific setup explained in this documentation

## *. Set up TestSpace

The TestSpace tool is used to display the unit test results, that are generated by the internal testing sequence of the project.

1. Go to https://www.testspace.com/

2. Click on the "Start for free" button

3. Click on the "Get started" button, under the "Open" plan box

4. Go to the bottom of the page, under "Pricing and setup" choose the "Free" option on the left and click on "Install it for free" button on the right
* the "Free" option is for personal accounts
* the "Open" option is for organization accounts

5. Click on the "Complete order and begin installation" button

6. Select which repositories to work with this TestSpace installation
* select "Only select repositories" for better overall control
* from the dropdown, select the repositories you would like to see on the TestSpace dashboard

7. Enter your password, if prompt

8. You are going to be re-directed to the TestSpace dashboard

9. At the top right corner, click on your account name and choose **Edit** from the dropdown menu

10. Copy the value from the input field under the **Access Token** label

11. Go to GitHub and enter your repo

12. In the **Settings** tab, go to **Secrets**, add a new secret with the name **TESTSPACE_TOKEN** and paste the value you copied in step 10

- the TestSpace token is optional for public repos, but we've made it part of the implementation, to give the owner of the repo additional security

13. Go back to your TestSpace dashboard

14. On the righthand side at the top, click on "+ New Project" button

15. Select the GitHub repo you would like to display and click "OK"

16. Click on the name of the project

17. As soon as a workflow is ran successfully for the connected GitHub project, you would be able to see the results listed here
* "space" refers to a GitHub repo branch (master, feature/new-feature etc.) and each branch is displayed as a separate entity

## *. Set up Dependabot

Dependabot is a GitHub native security tool that goes through the dependencies in the project and creates alerts, and PRs with updates when a new and/or non-vulnerable version is found.

- for PRs with version updates, this pipeline comes pre-configured for all current dependency sources in the project, so at "Insights" tab -> "Dependency graph" -> "Dependabot", you should be able to see all tracked sources of dependencies, when they have been checked last and view a full log of the last check

![Dependabot_tab](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_tab.png)

![Dependabot_log_page](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_log_page.png)

### Set up security alerts and updates
##### - GitHub, through Dependabot, also natively offers a security check for vulnerable dependencies

1. Go to the project's GitHub repository and click on the **Settings** tab

2. Go to **Security & analysis** section

3. Click "Enable" for both "Dependabot alerts" and "Dependabot security updates"

- By enabling "Dependabot alerts", you would be notified for any vulnerable dependencies in the project. At "Security" tab -> "Dependabot alerts", you can manage all alerts. By clicking on an alert, you would be able to see a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and a viable solution.

![Dependabot_alerts_page](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_alerts_page.png)

![Dependabot_alert_page](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_alert_page.png)

- By enabling "Dependabot security updates", you authorize Dependabot to create PRs specifically for **security updates**

![Dependabot_PRs](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_PRs.png)

### Set up Dependency graph
##### - The "Dependency graph" option should be enabled by default for all public repos, but in case it isn't:

1. Go to "Settings" tab of your repo

2. Go to "Security&Analysis" section

3. Click "Enable" for the "Dependency graph" option

- this option enables the "Insights" tab -> "Dependency graph" section -> "Dependencies" tab, in which all the dependencies for the project are listed, under the different manifests they are included in

![Dependabot_dependency_graph](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_dependency_graph.png)

NOTE: **screenshots are only exemplary**

## *. CodeQL

CodeQL is GitHub's own industry-leading semantic code analysis engine. CodeQL requires no setup, because it comes fully pre-configured by us. 

To activate it and see its results, only a push commit or a merge of a PR to the default branch of your repository, is required. 

We've also configured CodeQL to run on schedule, so every day at 8:00AM UTC, it automatically tests the code.

- you can see the results here at **Security** tab -> **Code scanning alerts** -> **CodeQL**:

![CodeQL_results](/ScreenShots/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/CodeQL_results.png)

- on the page of each result, you can see an explanation of what the problem is and also one or more solutions:

## *. How to create a release

The "Release sequence" encompasses creating a release in your GitHub repo and adding the necessary files to it.

Files added are: 
- Source code (zip)
- Source code (tar.gz)

Note: **not every commit to your master branch creates a release**

Follow these instructions for any commit (push or PR merge) to your master branch, you would like to create a release.

Whenever you would like to trigger the "Create release" sequence, you would need one of three keywords at the start of your commit title. Each of the three keywords corresponds to a number in your release version i.e. v1.2.3. The release versioning uses the ["Conventional Commits" specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

* "fix: ..." - this keyword corresponds to the last number v1.2.**3**, also known as PATCH;
* "feat: ..." - this keyword corresponds to the middle number v1.**2**.3, also known as MINOR;
* "perf: ..." - this keyword corresponds to the first number v**1**.2.3, also known as MAJOR. In addition, to trigger a MAJOR release, you would need to write "BREAKING CHANGE: ..." in the description of the commit, with an empty line above it to indicate it is in the <footer> portion of the description;

Note: when making a MAJOR release by committing through a terminal, use the multiple line syntax to add the commit title on one line and then adding an empty line, and then adding the "BREAKING CHANGE: " label
<br><br>
### EXAMPLES

Example(fix/PATCH): <br>
`
git commit -a -m "fix: this is a PATCH release triggering commit"
`
<br>
`
git push origin master
`
<br>
Result: v1.2.3 -> **v1.2.4**
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example(feat/MINOR): <br>
`
git commit -a -m "feat: this is a MINOR release triggering commit"
`
<br>
`
git push origin master
`
<br>
Result: v1.2.3 -> **v1.3.0**
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example(perf/MAJOR): <br>
``
git commit -a -m "perf: this is a MAJOR release triggering commit `
``
<br> 
&gt;&gt; <br> 
&gt;&gt; ` BREAKING CHANGE: this is the breaking change"
`
<br>
`
git push origin master
`
<br>
Result: v1.2.3 -> **v2.0.0**
<br>
<br>
Note: in the MAJOR release example, the PowerShell multiline syntax ` (backtick) is used. After writing a backtick, a press of the Enter key should open a new line.
